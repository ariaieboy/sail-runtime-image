# Sail Runtime Image

![Ariaieboy Sail Runtime Image](https://preview.dragon-code.pro/Ariaieboy/Sail%20Runtime%20Image.svg?brand=docker&github%5Brepository%5D=ariaieboy%2Fsail-runtime-image)
One of the Laravel Sail problems is the build step. Depending on your network and machine power, it might take a while
to build the image locally.
You can remove the build step by using our Pre-built images.

## Usage

After installing [laravel-sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail) you must remove the build step:

```diff
services:
    laravel.test:
-        build:
-            context: ./vendor/laravel/sail/runtimes/8.2
-            dockerfile: Dockerfile
-            args:
-                WWWGROUP: '${WWWGROUP}'
        image: sail-8.2/app
        extra_hosts:
            - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
        ports:
            - '${APP_PORT:-80}:80'
            - '${VITE_PORT:-5173}:${VITE_PORT:-5173}'
        environment:
            WWWUSER: '${WWWUSER}'
            LARAVEL_SAIL: 1
            XDEBUG_MODE: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE:-off}'
            XDEBUG_CONFIG: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_CONFIG:-client_host=host.docker.internal}'
```

Then you need to change the image to `ariaieboy/sail-runtime-image:version` the version can be `7.4`,`8.0`,`8.1`,`8.2`:

```diff
services:
    laravel.test:
+       image: ariaieboy/sail-runtime-image:8.2
        extra_hosts:
            - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
        ports:
            - '${APP_PORT:-80}:80'
            - '${VITE_PORT:-5173}:${VITE_PORT:-5173}'
        environment:
+           WEBSERVER: cli
+           WWWGROUP: '${WWWGROUP}'
            WWWUSER: '${WWWUSER}'
            LARAVEL_SAIL: 1
            XDEBUG_MODE: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE:-off}'
            XDEBUG_CONFIG: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_CONFIG:-client_host=host.docker.internal}'
```

The final `laravel.test` service should look like this:

```yml
services:
  laravel.test:
    image: ariaieboy/sail-runtime-image:8.2
    extra_hosts:
      - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
    ports:
      - '${APP_PORT:-80}:80'
      - '${VITE_PORT:-5173}:${VITE_PORT:-5173}'
    environment:
      WEBSERVER: cli
      WWWUSER: '${WWWUSER}'
      WWWGROUP: '${WWWGROUP}'
      LARAVEL_SAIL: 1
      XDEBUG_MODE: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE:-off}'
      XDEBUG_CONFIG: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_CONFIG:-client_host=host.docker.internal}'
    volumes:
      - '.:/var/www/html'
    networks:
      - sail
```

For using Alpine you can add `user` to the docker-compose service:

```yml
services:
  laravel.test:
    image: ariaieboy/sail-runtime-image:8.2-alpine
    user: "${WWWUSER}:${WWWGROUP}"
    extra_hosts:
      - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'
    ports:
      - '${APP_PORT:-80}:80'
      - '${VITE_PORT:-5173}:${VITE_PORT:-5173}'
    environment:
      WEBSERVER: cli
      LARAVEL_SAIL: 1
      XDEBUG_MODE: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_MODE:-off}'
      XDEBUG_CONFIG: '${SAIL_XDEBUG_CONFIG:-client_host=host.docker.internal}'
    volumes:
      - '.:/var/www/html'
    networks:
      - sail
```

## Customize Webserver

Our images support 3 Separate web server that you can choose from by setting the environment value of `WEBSERVER` in
your laravel service in the `docker-compose` file:

### `cli` (default)

This option uses the default `php artisan serve` supervisor conf from the `laravel-sail` repo.

### `octane`

This option uses `php artisan octane:serve` and will serve your application using octane instead of the
built-in `php artisan serve`

### `octane-watch`

This option uses octane webserver with `--watch` option.

## Difference with laravel-sail runtimes

### Pros

* It's Pre-built and you only need to pull it from docker hub.
* It supports 3 different Webserver without needing to change the image and rebuild it.
* Additional packages installed including `libavif-bin pnpm svgo libheif-dev jpegoptim optipng pngquant gifsicle`
* It will update weekly at 00:00 on Wednesday
* The image size is smaller than Laravel Sail default build
* Our Alpine variant is 60% smaller (475 vs 180 MB)

### cons

* It's not as customizable as `laravel-sail` if you want to customize it you need to build another image based on our
  images and build that image.

## Update the image

To update the image you only need to run `sail pull` and restart your containers.

## Version Support Policy 

Every Image has lots of dependencies that can have multiple versions.

We break this into 3 major components.

* OS version:

In base images, we are going to use the latest LTS version of the Ubuntu. For example, when PHP 8.3 was released the latest LTS version of Ubuntu was 22.04 so we created the base image using the Ubuntu 22.04.
In alpine variants, we use the PHP8.x-cli-alpine image as the base so we are tied to the PHP official docker image for the alpine version.

* NodeJS version:

In new tags, we are only supporting the latest LTS version of the NodeJS. For example, PHP 8.3 only supports NodeJS 20.
If a new LTS version of NodeJS is released, we are going to add a new image tag with that specific NodeJS version. But the default one will only be the first version.

* PostgreSQL Client:

Since every major version of PostgreSQL Client is backward compatible with all supported versions of PostgreSQL, we will update the Client to the latest version in all tags.

* Other components:

Every other component will be updated to the latest version with each build.

> We only support the active maintenance versions of the packages. For example, if the NodeJS 18 support ends we are gonna remove the tags that contain NodeJS 18 from the build process.

> You can still pull the latest builds for EOL tags but they are not gonna get updated anymore and you need to maintain those tags yourself.
